# Using BuildSim

BuildSim is the building provided for the project: a 3D viewer and a REST API in a single
binary. It **holds the building state** (rooms, equipment, sensor values, actuator states);
the project reads and writes that state. This tutorial runs BuildSim, puts a sensor and an
actuator in a room, and connects them with a **very simple physics simulator** so that
actuator commands change the sensor readings, the closed loop at the heart of the project.

## Part 1 — Start the BuildingSim server 

BuildSim is a single Go binary. From the D7065E repository root, build and
start it:

```bash
go build -o buildsim ./cmd
./buildsim start --port 9090
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:9090> in a current browser. The 3D building appears. The runtime state is **in memory**, so it resets every time BuildSim
restarts; keep a small script to recreate the equipment.

Alternatively, run the supplied container setup from the `buildingsim/` directory:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The browser still uses <http://127.0.0.1:9090>. Student services in the same Compose file
use `http://buildsim:9090`; `127.0.0.1` inside a container refers to that container, not to
the laptop or to BuildSim.

---

## Part 2 — Put a sensor and an actuator in a room

Equipment is placed using both its floor and room name (for example `level0` and `A109`).
Create the equipment, then add a sensor and an actuator. Children created this way **or in a
bulk request** are addressable through `/api/sensors/{id}` and `/api/actuators/{id}`:

```bash
BASE=http://127.0.0.1:9090

curl -X POST $BASE/api/equipment -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d \
  '{"id":"hvac-A109","name":"HVAC A109","type":"ac_unit","category":"hvac","level":"level0","room":"A109","status":"running"}'

curl -X POST $BASE/api/equipment/hvac-A109/sensors -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d \
  '{"id":"A109-temp","name":"Temperature","type":"temperature","data_type":"text","unit":"°C","value":"18.0"}'

curl -X POST $BASE/api/equipment/hvac-A109/actuators -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d \
  '{"id":"A109-set","name":"Setpoint","type":"setpoint","state":"21"}'
```

These three commands are bundled in [`buildsim/setup.sh`](buildsim/setup.sh).

Read either the sensor directly or its parent equipment:

```bash
curl -s "$BASE/api/sensors/A109-temp"
curl -s "$BASE/api/equipment/hvac-A109"
```

To print just the temperature value, use [`buildsim/gettemp.sh`](buildsim/gettemp.sh) (it
reports clearly if BuildSim is not running or the equipment was never created):

```bash
cd tutorials/buildsim
./gettemp.sh http://127.0.0.1:9090
# 18.0 °C
```

Sensor values and actuator states are always **text strings** (`"18.0"`, `"21"`), so the
code parses and formats them as numbers.

---

## Part 3 — A very simple physics simulator (close the loop)

The simulator is the program that makes actuator commands affect future sensor readings.
This one models a single idea: **the room temperature drifts toward the heating setpoint.**
Each tick it reads the setpoint actuator from BuildSim, nudges the temperature toward it,
and writes the new temperature back to the sensor.

`main.go`:

```go
package main

import (
	"bytes"
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"os"
	"strconv"
	"strings"
	"time"
)

const defaultBaseURL = "http://127.0.0.1:9090"

type actuator struct {
	ID    string `json:"id"`
	State string `json:"state"`
}

func main() {
	baseURL := strings.TrimRight(os.Getenv("BUILDSIM_URL"), "/")
	if baseURL == "" {
		baseURL = defaultBaseURL
	}
	client := &http.Client{Timeout: 5 * time.Second}
	temp := 18.0
	for {
		setpoint, next, err := step(client, baseURL, temp)
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}
		temp = next
		fmt.Printf("setpoint %.1f -> temp %.1f\n", setpoint, temp)
		time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
	}
}

func step(client *http.Client, baseURL string, temp float64) (float64, float64, error) {
	// 1. Read the heating setpoint from BuildSim.
	resp, err := client.Get(baseURL + "/api/actuators/A109-set")
	if err != nil {
		return 0, temp, fmt.Errorf("cannot reach BuildSim at %s: %w", baseURL, err)
	}
	if resp.StatusCode != http.StatusOK {
		_, _ = io.Copy(io.Discard, resp.Body)
		_ = resp.Body.Close()
		return 0, temp, fmt.Errorf("cannot read actuator: %s (did you run ./setup.sh?)", resp.Status)
	}
	var current actuator
	decodeErr := json.NewDecoder(resp.Body).Decode(&current)
	_ = resp.Body.Close()
	if decodeErr != nil {
		return 0, temp, fmt.Errorf("decode actuator: %w", decodeErr)
	}
	setpoint, err := strconv.ParseFloat(current.State, 64)
	if err != nil {
		return 0, temp, fmt.Errorf("actuator A109-set has invalid state %q: %w", current.State, err)
	}

	// 2. Very simple physics: move 20% of the way toward the setpoint.
	temp += 0.2 * (setpoint - temp)

	// 3. Write the new temperature back.
	body, err := json.Marshal(map[string]string{
		"data_type": "text", "value": fmt.Sprintf("%.1f", temp),
	})
	if err != nil {
		return 0, temp, fmt.Errorf("encode sensor value: %w", err)
	}
	req, err := http.NewRequest(http.MethodPut,
		baseURL+"/api/sensors/A109-temp/value", bytes.NewReader(body))
	if err != nil {
		return 0, temp, fmt.Errorf("create sensor request: %w", err)
	}
	req.Header.Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
	put, err := client.Do(req)
	if err != nil {
		return 0, temp, fmt.Errorf("cannot write to BuildSim: %w", err)
	}
	_, _ = io.Copy(io.Discard, put.Body)
	_ = put.Body.Close()
	if put.StatusCode != http.StatusOK {
		return 0, temp, fmt.Errorf("BuildSim rejected the write (%s), did you run ./setup.sh?", put.Status)
	}
	return setpoint, temp, nil
}
```

The complete runnable example, `main.go`, `go.mod`, and `setup.sh`, is in the
[`buildsim/`](buildsim/) folder. In another terminal, from the D7065E repository
root, create the equipment and start the simulator:

```bash
cd tutorials/buildsim
./setup.sh          # create hvac-A109 with its sensor and actuator
go run .            # start the simulator
# setpoint 21.0 -> temp 18.6
# setpoint 21.0 -> temp 19.1
# setpoint 21.0 -> temp 19.5  ...converging on 21
```

The program uses a five-second HTTP timeout instead of waiting forever for a
failed service. Set `BUILDSIM_URL` when BuildSim uses another address, for
example `BUILDSIM_URL=http://buildsim:9090 go run .` inside Compose.

Now **close the loop**: manually change the setpoint from another terminal and watch the
temperature follow it.

```bash
curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:9090/api/actuators/A109-set/state \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"state": "25"}'
# the simulator now drives temp up toward 25
```

The `curl` command is a manual workshop probe, not the final project architecture. In the
project, an autonomous decision service sends a command to an independently deployable
**actuator service**; that service validates and applies the state to BuildSim. Keeping those
roles separate makes device failure, stale commands, retries, and authority testable.

That is the whole idea of a cyber-physical loop: an **actuator** command (the setpoint)
changes the **physical** model (the temperature), which changes the next **sensor** reading,
which an autonomous agent would read to decide the next command. A real simulator adds more
effects (occupancy, heat loss, CO₂), but the shape stays exactly this.

## Part 4 — See it in the 3D viewer (optional)

The browser viewer is driven through a **session**. The modern viewer shows the first eight
characters of its session ID at the upper left; click the chip to copy the full ID. You can
also find the most recently active session through the API, then colour the room:

```bash
SID=$(curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9090/api/sessions | python3 -c '
import sys,json
s=sorted(json.load(sys.stdin),key=lambda x:x.get("last_ws_active",""))
print(s[-1]["id"] if s else "")')
if [ -z "$SID" ]; then
  echo "No viewer session found; open http://127.0.0.1:9090 first" >&2
  exit 1
fi
curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:9090/api/sessions/$SID/highlights \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '[{"level":"level0","room":"A109","color":"#e53935","opacity":0.5}]'
```

Use `level` and `room` in new code. The legacy `room_id` field is accepted, but numeric IDs
can repeat between floors and therefore require a level qualifier.

Highlights, coverage zones, and the viewport all update live over WebSocket, so a dashboard
is largely a matter of mapping state to colours. See `buildingsim/docs/api/sessions.md` for
the full session API.

---

## Part 5 — Show physical state, fire, movement, and doors

A sensor is an observation from one device. The simulator's current room temperature is
physical state, and a predicted fire risk is an estimate. Publish state and estimates as
**room layers** instead of inventing a sensor to hold each value:

```bash
curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:9090/api/room-layers \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '[{
  "id":"temperature","label":"Simulated room temperature","unit":"°C",
  "source":"simulation truth","minimum":18,"maximum":40,
  "values":{"level0/A109":38.2,"level0/A110":29.6}
}]'
```

The viewer also accepts renderer instructions for `fire`, `smoke`, `gas`, `sprinkler`,
`water`, and `warning` effects. These instructions do not simulate anything: the physical
model must still calculate how the phenomenon changes and publish each new snapshot.

To see only a room-temperature heatmap, run this from the `buildingsim/` directory:

```bash
./examples/api/room-layers/set_temperature_heatmap.sh
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:9090/?layer=temperature&floor=level0>. The script shows how
room values, a fixed numeric range, and a colour palette form a comparable heatmap.

Run the complete example from the `buildingsim/` directory:

```bash
./examples/api/scenario/show_visual_effects.sh
```

Then open
<http://127.0.0.1:9090/?layer=temperature&floor=level0&room=A109>. The example combines a
temperature layer, animated fire and smoke, an active sprinkler, exact equipment positions,
a person, a cleaning robot, room lighting, decision alerts, an exterior entrance, a fire
exit, and a locked door. Because the A109 door is linked to its walkable entry node, routes
through that door are unavailable until it is unlocked.

The full payloads and semantics are in the [visualization
API](../buildingsim/docs/api/visualization.md) and [doors and locks
API](../buildingsim/docs/api/doors.md). Clear transient visual state with:

```bash
./examples/api/scenario/clear_visual_effects.sh
```

## Things to remember

- **Values are text.** Sensor `value` and actuator `state` are strings; parse and format them.
- **Qualify rooms.** Use `level` plus room name (`level0`, `A109`), or the canonical
  `level0/A109` map key. Names and numeric IDs can repeat on different floors.
- **Mutations notify automatically.** Successful equipment, sensor, and actuator writes
  update the version and refresh connected viewers. Normal clients must not call the legacy
  `/api/equipment/notify` endpoint.
- **No persistence, no physics.** BuildSim stores the current state only and does not model
  physics, the simulator above is the project's job.
- **State is not a sensor.** A room layer may be simulation truth or an estimate; a sensor
  remains a device observation, and an effect is only a rendering instruction.
- **Closed is not locked.** A closed but unlocked door remains routable. Locked, jammed, or
  blocked doorway nodes are excluded from walkable routes.
